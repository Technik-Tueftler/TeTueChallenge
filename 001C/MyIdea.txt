### WHAT TO DO ####
Sorting the list based on three different attributes "SECRETS PLAYTIME KILLS".
Each attribute has different weighting. SECRETS first, PLAYTIME second, KIllS last.
PLAYTIME is in inverse logic.

### The PROBLEM ####
Sorting the list one by one for each attribute is not very effective and therefore not an option.

### The IDEA ####
Create an "player_highscore" based on the three attributes SECRETS PLAYTIME KILLS.
With this "player_highscore" all player attributes are combined into one single value.
This will make the sorting much more effective because the complete
 list needs to be sorted only once based on the "player_highscore"
This "player_highscore" can also be used for showing the player his actual score
 at the end of an game stage for example.

### Implementation Idea ####
Build an value which combines all attributes.
Adding them will not work, because "3 secrets are better than 100 kills" and "2 minutes are better than 10 minutes".
Two overcome this problem each attribute has a predefined bit range in the "player_highscore"
By bit shifting the attribute more to the left inside the "player_highscore"
 the weighting of the attribute will be increased.

The following diagram will show this in much more detail based on the given MAX_* values.
MAX_SECRETS = 999
MAX_PLAYTIME = 9999999
MAX_KILLS = 999999

### Sorting ###
Started with a simple implementation of quicksort....

Based on the general problem by choosing the correct pivot element,
the stability of the algorithm and the fact the the python "sorting" is extreme fast ...

... the python build in "sorting" algorithm will be used.

Fast, Tested, Already there => This is why we use Python ;)
